# SQL_EDA_Project
This is a SQL Exploratory Data Analysis Project.
The following steps were performed in this project:

1.Importing raw data to MYSQL Workbench

2.Creating a staging table similar to raw data table , so that we can proceed with Data cleaning.

3.Data Cleaning which compromised of:
  a.Removing Duplicates
  b.Standardizing the data
  c.Dealing with null values/blank values
  d.Removing any unnecessary columns

4.Then the clean data was analyzed to answer the following questions:

  i>   What was the maximum number of layoffs in one day?
  ii>  What was the maximum percentage layoffs in one day?
  iii> What was the total number of layoffs by each company?
  iv>  If any, which companies have laid off all employees?
  v>   What is the time period over which the data was collected?
  vi>  Which industry has most number of layoffs?
  vii> Which country's companies has most number of layoffs?
  viii>In which year, most number of layoffs took place?
  ix>  Calculate the rolling total layoffs per month?
  x>   Which are the top 5 companies in each year in terms of total layoffs?
